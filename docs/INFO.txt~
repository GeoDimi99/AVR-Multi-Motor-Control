The termios functions describe a general terminal interface that is provided to control asynchronous communications ports.

   The termios structure
       Many of the functions described here have a termios_p argument that is a pointer to a termios structure.  This structure contains at least the following members:

           tcflag_t c_iflag;      /* input modes */
           tcflag_t c_oflag;      /* output modes */
           tcflag_t c_cflag;      /* control modes */
           tcflag_t c_lflag;      /* local modes */
           cc_t     c_cc[NCCS];   /* special characters */

- tcgetattr() prende i parametri associati all'oggetto riferiti dal fd e gli memorizza nella struttura termios riferenziate dal termios_p. This function may be invoked from a background  process;  however,
       the terminal attributes may be subsequently changed by a foreground process.

- cfmakeraw() sets the terminal to something like the "raw" mode of the old Version 7 terminal driver: input is available character by character, echoing is disabled, and all special processing of terminal in‐
       put and output characters is disabled.  The terminal attributes are set as follows:

           termios_p->c_iflag &= ~(IGNBRK | BRKINT | PARMRK | ISTRIP
                           | INLCR | IGNCR | ICRNL | IXON);
           termios_p->c_oflag &= ~OPOST;
           termios_p->c_lflag &= ~(ECHO | ECHONL | ICANON | ISIG | IEXTEN);
           termios_p->c_cflag &= ~(CSIZE | PARENB);
           termios_p->c_cflag |= CS8;
